# Real Estate Market Analysis in Argentina

Welcome to the Real Estate Market Analysis project for Argentina! This repository is dedicated to providing insights into the current state of the real estate market in Argentina. Through scraping data from "zonaprop," a popular real estate platform, we aim to offer valuable information and analysis regarding apartments for rent.

## Overview

The primary objective of this project is to gather comprehensive data on apartments available for rent in Argentina's real estate market. By utilizing web scraping techniques, we collect detailed features and attributes of various apartments listed on "zonaprop." The gathered data serves as a foundation for conducting in-depth analysis and deriving insights into market trends, pricing dynamics, and other relevant factors.

## Repository Structure

* **main_scrap.py** : This Python script serves as the main entry point for initiating the web scraping process. Users can specify their preferences and select the type of buildings they are interested in to gather relevant information. The scraped data is stored in the "output" folder for further analysis.
* **output/** : This directory contains the output files generated by the scraping process. Each file corresponds to the data collected for a specific type of building or category.
* **jupyter/** : The Jupyter notebook files within this folder are dedicated to the analysis of the scraped data. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and statistical techniques, we delve into the insights derived from the collected real estate data.
